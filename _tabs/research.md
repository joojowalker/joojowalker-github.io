## Research Interest
My research interests primarily revolve around the design of deep learning and privacy-preserving algorithms aimed at addressing critical societal challenges. Currently, I am actively engaged in the development of innovative deep generative models to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and security of recommendation systems and educational technologies.
